# Redshift Rates Tutorial

This tutorial was prepared by Eve Chase for an interactive demonstration at the March 2018 LIGO-Virgo Collaboration Meeting.

Follow the Jupyter notebook for a basic working example of the redshift rates package, which uses a Poissonian mixture model to extract the binary black hole merger rate as a function of cosmological redshift.

This repository depends on a submodule which is currently only available to LVK members in the private GitLab repository: https://git.ligo.org/chris-pankow/gw_event_gen. LVK members can also access a complete mirror of this tutorial at https://git.ligo.org/eve.chase/redshift_rates_lvctutorial/.
